# AutoFujiSim-LR

This is a simple plugin to address a really annoying problem when working with Fujifilm's RAW (RAF) files in Lightroom: film simulations. 

Imagine you are out shooting and you think to yourself, wow, that abandoned house would look *really* great in black and white, so you switch to the ACROS simulation. Later on, you come across a beautiful autumn scene, bursting with colors, that is really just begging for the Velvia/Vivid simulation. So far so good, but when you get home and import these photos into Lightroom, all of your photos will default to "Adobe Color." 

Of course, you could try to remember which film simulations you used at the time and manually apply them, but for larger imports, this quickly gets tiresome. Instead, this plugin allows you to simply select a menu option and watch all of your selected photos switch to the film simulation you chose while out shooting. Honestly, I think this should be the default behavior, but I'll use this plugin until Adobe fixes it.
